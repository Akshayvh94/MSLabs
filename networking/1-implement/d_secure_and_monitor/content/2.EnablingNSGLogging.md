#### Part C - Enabling NSG Logging

Diagnostic logging must be enabled for each NSG you want to collect data for. You can enable the following diagnostic log categories for NSGs:

- **Event:** Contains entries for which NSG rules are applied to VMs and instance roles based on MAC address. The status for these rules is collected every 60 seconds.

- **Rule counter:** Contains entries for how many times each NSG rule is applied to deny or allow traffic.

In this lab, you will enable diagnostics logging on an NSG and review filtering options and logged data.
