## Experience A - Enable diagnostics and use Azure Monitor

In this lab, you will learn about various Azure logging and monitoring options and how to enable diagnostics on Azure objects like an Azure VM. You will also learn how to use Azure Monitor to view log and monitoring data across the Azure control plane and create custom queries. 

1. [Click here to open the Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)

1. **Maximize** the browser window

1. In the **Email or phone** field, enter **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"/>**

1. In the **Password** field, enter **<inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"/>**

1. Click **Sign in**

1. If you get  a **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** popup window, click **Maybe Later** to skip the tour

1. In the **Favorites** menu, click **Virtual machines**

1. On the **Virtual machines** blade, click **BackendVM0** in the list of virtual machines

1. On the **BackendVM0** blade in the left pane under **MONITORING**, click **Diagnostics settings**

    > **Note:** Azure Monitoring collects host-level metrics like CPU utilization, disk and network usage for all virtual machines without any additional software. For more insight into a virtual machine, you can collect guest-level metrics, logs, and other diagnostic data using the Azure Diagnostics agent. You can also send diagnostic data to other services like Application Insights. [Click here to learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/azure-diagnostics).

1. On the **BackendVM0 - Diagnostics settings** blade under the **Overview** tab in the right pane, click **Enable guest-level monitoring**

    > **Note:** When you enable guest-level monitoring, the following data is collected by default:

        - Performance counters (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network)
        - Event logs (Application, Security, System)
        - Boot diagnostics

1. Click the **Performance counters** link near the top of the page (or click the **Configure performance counters** link on the **Overview** page)

1. Verify **Basic** is selected

    > **Note:** Select **None** to disable collection of performance counters. Select **Custom** if you want more control over which performance counters are collected.

1. Click the **CPU** row in the table

1. Change the **SAMPLE RATE (SECONDS)** to **90**

1. Clear the check in the box next to **Network** to disable the **Network** performance counter

1. Click the box next to **Upgrade your performance counters in the selected categories to the latest version**

1. Click **Save** near the top left corner of the pane

1. Click the **Logs** link near the top of the page (or click the **Configure event logs** link or the **Configure directories** link on the **Overview** page)

1. Verify **Basic** is selected

    > **Note:** Select **None** to disable collection of event logs. Select **Custom** if you want more control over which event logs are collected.

1. Click the box next to **Audit success** under **SECURITY** to enable successful logon events

1. Scroll down to view the **Directories**, **Application logs**, and **Event tracing for Windows (ETW) events** configuration options

1. Click **Save** near the top left corner of the pane

1. Click the **Crash dumps** link near the top of the page (or click the **Configure crash dumps** link on the **Overview** page)

1. Click **Enabled** to view the required configuration settings for crash dumps on this page

1. Click **Discard** near the top left corner of the pane

1. Click the **Sinks** link near the top of the page (or click the **Configure sinks** link on the **Overview** page)

1. Click **Enabled** to send diagnostic data to Application Insights and review the required configuration settings for Application Insights on this page

    > **Note:** Use Application Insights to analyze data of applications running in a virtual machine. [Click here to learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/azure-diagnostics-configure-application-insights).

1. Click **Discard** near the top left corner of the pane

1. Click the **Agent** link near the top of the page (or click the **Configure agent** link on the **Overview** page)

1. Review the required configuration settings for the Azure Diagnostics agent on this page

    > **Note:** If diagnostic data isn't being collected or you're having trouble viewing it in the portal, reinstalling the agent might help. To uninstall the agent, click **Remove** at the bottom of the **Agent** page. This removes the agent, but keeps all existing diagnostic data in your storage account. After the agent is removed, you can re-enable diagnostics for the virtual machine.

1. Click the **Overview** link near the top of the page and scroll to the bottom of the page

1. Click the **View boot diagnostics** link

1. On the **Boot diagnostics** blade, click **Screenshot** near the top left corner of the blade to capture a bitmap image of any real-time boot diagnostics messages that appear on the blade

1. Click **Settings** near the top center of the blade (or click the **Configure boot diagnostics** link near the bottom of the **Overview** page) to open the **Boot diagnostics** blade

1. Review the required configuration settings for boot diagnostics on this blade

1. Click the **X** near the top right corner of the blade to close the **Boot diagnostics** settings blade

1. Click the **X** near the top right corner of the blade to close the **Boot diagnostics** blade

1. Click the **X** near the top right corner of the blade to close the **BackendVM0 - Diagnostics settings** blade

1. Click the **X** near the top right corner of the blade to close the **Virtual machines** blade

1. At the top center of the Azure portal, type **monitor** in the **Search resources** box and press **Enter**

    - Add activity log alert
    - Create new support request
