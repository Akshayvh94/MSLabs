## Part A - Enabling Diagnostics and Using Azure Monitor

**Azure Monitor** is the platform service that provides a single source for monitoring Azure resources. With Azure Monitor, you can visualize, query, route, archive, and take action on the metrics and logs coming from resources in Azure.

In this lab, you will learn about various Azure logging and monitoring options. You will also learn how to use Azure Monitor to view log and monitoring data across the Azure control plane and create custom queries. 

1. [Click here to open the Azure portal](launch://launch_ie_browse_azure_portal)

1. **Maximize** the browser window

1. In the **Email or phone** field, enter **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"/>** and click **Next**

1. In the **Password** field, enter **<inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"/>** and click **Sign in**

1. In the **Stay signed in?** window, click **No**

1. If you get  a **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** popup window, click **Maybe Later** to skip the tour

1. In the **Favorites** menu, click **Virtual machines**

1. On the **Virtual machines** blade in the list of virtual machines, click **BackendVM0** 

1. On the **BackendVM0** blade in the left pane under **MONITORING**, click **Diagnostics settings**

    > **Note: Azure Monitoring** collects host-level metrics like CPU utilization, disk, and network usage for all virtual machines without any additional software. For more insight into a virtual machine, you can collect guest-level metrics, logs, and other diagnostic data using the **Azure Diagnostics agent**. You can also send diagnostic data to other services like **Application Insights**. [Click here to learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/azure-diagnostics).

1. On the **BackendVM0 - Diagnostics settings** blade click the **Performance counters** tab next to the **Overview** tab 

    > **Note:** Guest-level monitoring has already been enabled for this lab, however, it is not enabled on Azure VMs by default. To enable guest-level monitoring on a VM, you would click **Enable guest-level monitoring** on the **Overview** tab (if it is already enabled, this option does not appear). When you enable guest-level monitoring, the following data is collected by default: Performance counters (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network), Event logs (Application, Security, System), Boot diagnostics

1. On the **Performance counters** page, click **Basic**

    > **Note:** Select **None** to disable collection of performance counters. Select **Custom** if you want more control over which performance counters are collected.

1. Click the box next to **CPU** in the table and change the **SAMPLE RATE (SECONDS)** to **90**

1. Click the box next to **Network** in the table and change the **SAMPLE RATE (SECONDS)** to **90**

1. Click the **Logs** tab next to the **Performance counters** tab near the top of the page

1. Verify **Basic** is selected

    > **Note:** Select **None** to disable collection of event logs. Select **Custom** if you want more control over which event logs are collected.

1. Click the box next to **Audit success** under **SECURITY** to enable successful logon events

1. Scroll down to view the **Directories**, **Application logs**, and **Event tracing for Windows (ETW) events** configuration options

1. Click the **Crash dumps** tab next to the **Logs** tab near the top of the page

1. Click **Enabled** to view the required configuration settings for crash dumps on this page

1. Click the **Sinks** tab next to the **Crash dumps** tab near the top of the page

1. Click **Enabled** to send diagnostic data to Application Insights and review the required configuration settings for Application Insights on this page

    > **Note:** Use Application Insights to analyze data of applications running in a virtual machine. [Click here to learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/azure-diagnostics-configure-application-insights).

1. Click the **Agent** tab next to the **Sinks** tab near the top of the page

1. Review the required configuration settings for the Azure Diagnostics agent on this page

    > **Note:** If diagnostic data isn't being collected or you're having trouble viewing it in the portal, reinstalling the agent might help. To uninstall the agent, click **Remove** at the bottom of the **Agent** page. This removes the agent, but keeps all existing diagnostic data in your storage account. After the agent is removed, you can re-enable diagnostics for the virtual machine.

1. Click the **Overview** link near the top left of the page and scroll to the bottom of the page

1. Under **Boot diagnostics**, click the **Configure boot diagnostics** link

1. On the **Boot diagnostics** blade, review the required configuration settings for boot diagnostics

1. Click the **X** near the top right corner of the blade to close the **Boot diagnostics** blade

1. Click the **X** near the top right corner of the blade to close the **BackendVM0 - Diagnostics settings** blade

1. In the popup window, click **OK** to discard your unsaved edits



---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. At the top center of the Azure portal, type **monitor** in the **Search resources, services and docs** box

1. Under **SERVICES** in the results list, click **Monitor**

1. On the **Monitor - Activity log** blade, note the **Insights (Last 24 hours)** links near the top right corner of the blade

1. Click on any of the links (**failed deployments, role assignments, errors, alerts fired, outage notifications**) to view details about the event(s) in the list below

    > **Note:** There is a **Click here to download all the items as csv** link at the top of the table that enables you to export activity log data to a spreadsheet.

1. Click on any event in the list to view additional details (in summary or JSON format) about the event and perform additional actions, such as:

    - Add activity log alert
    - Create new support request

1. Click **Columns** near the top left corner of the right pane

1. On the **Choose columns** blade, check or un-check columns to customize the table on the **Monitor - Activity log** blade

1. On the **Monitor - Activity log** blade, click **Export** near the top left corner of the right pane

1. On the **Export activity log** blade, you can configure your activity log to archive to a storage account or stream it to an Azure event hub

    > **Note:** Diagnostic data is billed at normal storage rates.

1. Click the **X** near the right corner of the blade to close the **Export activity log** blade

1. On the **Monitor - Activity log** blade near the top of the right pane, note the various dropdown menus available to create custom activity log queries
