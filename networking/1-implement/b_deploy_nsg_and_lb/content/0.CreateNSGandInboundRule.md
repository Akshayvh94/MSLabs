#### Part A - Creating a Network Security Group (NSG) and Inbound Security Rule

A **network security group (NSG)** contains a list of security rules that allow or deny network traffic to resources connected to Azure VNets. NSGs can be associated to subnets, individual VMs (classic), or individual network interfaces attached to VMs (Resource Manager). When an NSG is associated to a subnet, the rules apply to all resources connected to the subnet. Traffic can further be restricted by also associating an NSG to a VM or network interface.

In this lab, you will create a network security group (NSG) and an inbound security rule to allow RDP access.

1. [Click here to open the Azure portal](launch://launch_ie_browse_azure_portal)

1. **Maximize** the browser window

1. In the **Email or phone** field, enter **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"/>** and click **Next**

1. In the **Password** field, enter **<inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"/>** and click **Sign in**

1. In the **Stay signed in?** window, click **No**

1. If you get  a **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** popup window, click **Maybe Later** to skip the tour

1. In the **Favorites** menu, click **New**

1. In the **Search the Marketplace** box, type **network security group** and press **Enter**

1. On the **Everything** blade, click **Network security group** in the **Results** list

1. On the **Network security group** blade, leave **Resource Manager** selected in the **Select a deployment model** dropdown menu

1. Click **Create**

1. On the **Create network security group** blade under **Name**, type **backend-nsg**

1. In the **Subscription** dropdown menu, select **<inject story-id="story://content-private/content/iai/networking/netshared" key="subscriptionName"/>**

1. Under **Resource group**, change the radio button to **Use existing** and select **<inject story-id="story://content-private/content/iai/networking/netshared" key="resourceGroupName"/>** in the **Resource group** dropdown menu

1. In the **Location** dropdown menu, select **Central US**

1. Click **Create**

    > **Note:** The NSG will take several minutes to deploy in Azure. You can track the deployment progress in the Azure portal by clicking on the **Notifications** icon ![image](imgs/notifications.png).

1. In the **Favorites** menu, scroll to the bottom of the list and click **More services >**

1. In the expanded **Favorites** menu, click the **Favorite** icon ![image](imgs/star.png) next to **Network security groups** to add it to your **Favorites** menu

1. Click **Network security groups**

1. On the **Network security groups** blade, click **backend-nsg**
 
1. On the **backend-nsg** blade under **SETTINGS**, click **Inbound security rules**

1. On the **backend-nsg - Inbound security rules** blade, note the following default rules:

    - **AllowVnetInBound** (permits source traffic from the virtual network to destinations in the virtual network)
    - **AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound** (permits Azure load balancers to send health probes)
    - **DenyAllInBound** (blocks all traffic that is not explicitly permitted by another rule)

1. Click **Add** near the top of the blade

1. On the **Add inbound security rule** blade, click **Basic** near the top left corner of the blade

1. In the **Service** dropdown menu, select **RDP**

    > **Note:** The **service** specifies the destination protocol and port range for this rule. You can choose a predefined service from the dropdown menu or select **Custom** and specify a **Protocol** (*Any, TCP, or UDP*) and **Port range** (*single port, range of ports, or any port*).

1. Under **Priority**, leave the default value **(100)**

    > **Note:** Rules are processed in priority order; the lower the number, the higher the priority. Each rule must be assigned a unique priority number between 100 and 4096. It is highly recommended that you leave gaps between rules (for example, 100, 200, 300, etc.) so that it's easier to add new rules without having to edit existing rules.

1. Under **Name**, type **rdp-rule**

1. Near the top left corner of the **Add inbound security rule** blade, click **Advanced**

1. Under **Source** select **Any**

    > **Note:** The **Any** filter permits/blocks traffic from any source IP address. The **CIDR block** filter permits/blocks traffic from an IP address range. The **Tag** filter permits/blocks traffic from a default Azure tag (such as *Internet, VirtualNetwork, or AzureLoadBalancer*).

1. Under **Source port ranges** leave the default wildcard **( * )** entry

1. Under **Destination** select **Any**

1. Under **Destination port ranges** leave the default port **(3389)** entry

1. Under **Protocol** leave the default selection **(TCP)**

1. Under **Action** click **Allow**

1. Click **OK**

    > **Note:** The inbound security rule will take several minutes to deploy in Azure. You can track the deployment progress in the Azure portal by clicking on the **Notifications** icon ![image](imgs/notifications.png).

1. After the deployment has succeeded, note the **rdp-rule** has been added to the list on the **backend-nsg - Inbound security rules** blade
