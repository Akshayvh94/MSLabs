#### Part B - Deploying an Internal Load Balancer

**Azure load balancer** delivers high availability and network performance to your applications. It is a Layer 4 (TCP, UDP) load balancer that distributes incoming traffic among healthy instances of services defined in a load-balanced set.

In this lab you will deploy an internal load balancer to distribute inbound SQL cluster (port 1433) traffic.

1. In the **Favorites** menu, click **Virtual networks**

1. In the **Favorites** menu, click **Load balancers**

1. On the **Load balancers** blade, click **Add** near the top left corner of the blade

1. On the **Create load balancer** blade in the **Location** dropdown menu near the bottom, change the location to the same location that you noted earlier for the **VNet**

    > **Note:** The load balancer must be created in the same location as the VNet for the VM resources you want to deploy with the load balancer. 

1. On the **Create load balancer** blade under **Name** near the top, type **webintlb1**

1. Under **Type**, select **Internal**

1. Under **SKU**, leave the default setting **(Basic)**

1. Under **Virtual network**, click **Choose a virtual network** 

    > **Note:** A **virtual network** named **corpnet** and associated subnet has already been created for this lab.

1. On the **Choose a virtual network** blade, click **corpnet**

1. On the **Create load balancer** blade under **Subnet**, click **Choose a subnet**

1. On the **Choose subnet** blade, click **Subnet-2**

1. On the **Create load balancer** blade under **IP address assignment**, select **Static**

1. In the **Private IP address field**, type **10.1.1.110**

1. Select  **<inject story-id="story://content-private/content/iai/networking/netshared" key="subscriptionName"/>** in the **Subscription** dropdown menu

1. Under **Resource group**, change the radio button to **Use existing** and select **<inject story-id="story://content-private/content/iai/networking/netshared" key="resourceGroupName"/>** in the **Resource group** dropdown menu

1. Click **Create**

1. In the **Favorites** menu, click **Load balancers**

1. On the **Load balancers** blade, click **webintlb1** in the list

1. On the **webintlb1** blade under **SETTINGS**, click **Frontend IP configuration**

1. On the **webintlb1 - Frontend IP configuration** blade, note the **LoadBalancerFrontEnd** in the list in the right pane

    > **Note:** The **LoadBalancerFrontEnd** and associated **IP address** were configured when you created the load balancer.

1. Under **SETTINGS** in the left pane, click **Backend pools**

1. On the **webintlb1 - Backend pools** blade, click **Add** near the top left corner of the right pane

1. On the **Add backend pool** blade under **Name**, type **backendpool1**

1. In the **Associated to** dropdown menu, select **Availability set**
 
    > **Note:** An **availability set** named **backendAS** has already been created for this lab.

1. Select **backendAS** in the **Availability set** dropdown menu

1. Click **Add a target network IP configuration**

    > **Note:** Virtual machines named **BackendVM0** and **BackendVM1** have already been created for this lab.

1. Select **BackendVM0** in the **Target virtual machine** dropdown menu

1. Select **ipconfig1** in the **Network IP configuration** dropdown menu

1. Click **Add a target network IP configuration**

1. Select **BackendVM1** in the **Target virtual machine** dropdown menu

1. Select **ipconfig1** in the **Network IP configuration** dropdown menu

1. Click **OK**

1. On the **webintlb1 - Backend pools** blade in the right pane, click the **right arrow** icon ![image](imgs/rightArrow.png) next to **backendpool1** in the list to view additional information about the virtual machines in the pool 

1. On the left pane under **SETTINGS**, click **Health probes**

1. On the **webintlb1 - Health probes** blade, click **Add** near the top left corner of the right pane

1. On the **Add health probe** blade under **Name**, type **probe1**

1. Select **TCP** under **Protocol**

1. Change **Port** to **1433**

1. Change **Interval** to **60**

1. Change **Unhealthy threshold** to **3**

1. Click **OK**

1. On the left pane under **SETTINGS**, click **Load balancing rules**

1. On the **webintlb1 - Load balancing rules** blade, click **Add** near the top left corner of the right pane

1. On the **Add load balancing rule** blade under **Name**, type **sqlsvr-rule**

1. Under **IP Version**, verify **IPv4** is selected 

1. Verify the **(LoadBalancerFrontEnd)** IP address is selected in the **Frontend IP address** dropdown menu

1. Verify **Protocol** is **TCP**

1. Under **Port**, type **1433**

1. Under **Backend port**, type **1433**

1. In the **Backend pool** dropdown menu, verify **backendpool1** is selected

1. In the **Health probe** dropdown menu, verify **probe1** is selected

1. In the **Session persistence** dropdown menu, verify **None** is selected in

    > **Note:** Session persistence specifies that traffic from a client should be handled by the same virtual machine in the backend pool for the duration of a session. **None** specifies that successive requests from the same client may be handled by any virtual machine. **Client IP** specifies that successive requests from teh same client IP address will be handled by the same virtual machine. **Client IP and protocol** specifies that successive requests from the same client IP address and protocol combination will be handled by the same virtual machine.

1. Use the slider bar to increase the **Idle timeout (minutes)** to **20**

1. Verify **Floating IP (direct server return)** is **Disabled**

    > **Note:** The floating IP feature is recommended only when configuring a SQL AlwaysOn Availability Group Listener. It can only be enabled when creating a rule and if the port and backend port match.

1. Click **OK**
