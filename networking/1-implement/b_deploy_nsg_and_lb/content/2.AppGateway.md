#### Part C - Creating an Application Gateway

**Azure application gateway** is a dedicated virtual appliance providing application delivery controller (ADC) as a service. It offers various Layer 7 load balancing capabilities for your application. It allows customers to optimize web farm productivity by offloading CPU-intensive SSL termination to the application gateway. It also provides other Layer 7 routing capabilities including round robin distribution of incoming traffic, cookie-based session affinity, URL path-based routing, and the ability to host multiple websites behind a single application gateway.

A web application firewall (WAF) is also provided as part of the application gateway WAF SKU. It provides protection to web applications from common web vulnerabilities and exploits. Application gateway can be configured as an Internet-facing gateway, internal-only gateway, or a combination of both.

In this lab you will deploy a basic application gateway.

1. In the **Favorites** menu, click **More services >** at the bottom of the menu

1. In the expanded **Favorites** menu, type **application gateways** in the search box and press **Enter**

1. Click **Add** near the top left corner of the **Application gateways** blade

1. On the **Basics** blade located to the right of the **Create application gateway** blade, type **appgw1** under **Name**

1. Under **Tier**, select **Standard**

1. In the **SKU size** dropdown menu, select **Small**

1. Leave the **Instance count** set to **2**

1. In the **Subscription** dropdown menu, select **<inject story-id="story://content-private/content/iai/networking/netshared" key="subscriptionName"/>**

1. Under **Resource group**, change the radio button to **Use existing** and select **<inject story-id="story://content-private/content/iai/networking/netshared" key="resourceGroupName"/>** in the **Resource group** dropdown menu

1. In the **Location** dropdown menu, select the same location you deployed the internal load balancer to in Part B of this lab

    > **Note:** Your virtual network and public IP address must be in the same location as your gateway. If you plan on using existing resources, ensure that you select the correct location .

1. Click **OK**

1. On the **Settings** blade under **Subnet configuration**, click **Choose a virtual network** under **Virtual network**

1. On the **Choose virtual network** blade, click **corpnet**

1. In the **Subnet** dropdown menu, select **appgw-subnet(10.1.2.0/24)**

1. Under **Frontend IP configuration**, leave the default **IP address type** setting **(Public)**

1. Under **Public IP address**, click **Choose a public IP address**

1. On the **Choose public IP address** blade, click **Create new**

1. On the **Create public IP address** blade under **Name**, type **appgw1-ip**

1. Under **SKU**, leave the default setting **(Basic)**

1. Click **OK**

1. On the **Settings** blade under **Listener configuration**, leave the default **Protocol** setting **(HTTP)** 

1. Under **Port**, leave the default setting **(80)**

1. Click **OK**

1. On the **Summary** blade, click **OK**

    > **Note:** The application gateway will take several minutes to deploy in Azure.
    
1. Click the **Notifications** icon ![image](imgs/notifications.png) in the top menu bar to open the **Notifications** window

1. When the deployment completes, click **Go to resource** in the popup window

1. On the **appgw1** blade under **SETTINGS**, click **Backend pools**

1. On the **appgw1 - Backend pools** blade in the right pane, click **appGatewayBackendPool**

1. On the **appGatewayBackendPool** blade, click **Add target**

1. Under type, click the **Virtual machine** radio button

    > **Note:** Virtual machines named **FrontendVM0** and **FrontendVM1** have already been created for this lab.

1. In the **Virtual machine** dropdown menu, select **FrontendVM0**

1. Click **Add target**

1. Under type, click the **Virtual machine** radio button

1. In the **Virtual machine** dropdown menu, select **FrontendVM1**

1. Click **Save**

1. Under **SETTINGS**, click **Listeners**

    > **Note:** The **appGatewayHttpListener** is automatically created when you create an application gateway. A listener directs traffic to the appropriate backend pool based on the configured rules.

1. Under **SETTINGS**, click **Rules**

1. On the **appgw1 - Rules** blade, note that a default rule named **rule1** is automatically created

    > **Note:** When you create a basic rule, you select a **Listener** and a **Backend pool**. A **basic** rule implements port forwarding. You can also do **path-based** routing rules.
