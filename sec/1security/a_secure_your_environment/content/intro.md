**The Contoso Story:** 

Contoso Coffee is a rapidly growing company that operates in many US states and internationally. They have built their business from the ground up and recently purchased a smaller company operating in several states where they previously had no presence. They have staff that are mobile, working with their customers on-site and with suppliers in remote locations around the world.
 
Contoso Coffee's infrastructure is complex. It is hosted on several different platforms and in different datacenters. The recent purchase of the smaller company has added to their infrastructure complexity. They have selected Azure as the primary provider for their infrastructure services due to the breadth and depth of available content.

Contoso Coffee's recent acquisition has highlighted the need for a review of their security policies and processes. As many of their resources are moving to Azure, Contoso Coffee has decided to use the built-in features of Azure Security Center to manage security. As their data is being moved to Azure, multiple opportunities exist to access data in various forms, from outside of Contoso Coffee's corporate network. Due to this new exposure, data security has become a higher priority for Contoso Coffee. 

You decide to further investigate the built-in security reporting and analysis tools in Azure. You enable Azure Security Center and open the console to see what the analysis is reporting for the Contoso Azure environment.
