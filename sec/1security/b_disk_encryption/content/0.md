# VM Disk Encryption from Build

1. [Click here to open PowerShell ISE](launch://launch_ise)

      >**NOTE:** To simplify the process of encrypting Azure Virtual Machines, Microsoft has provided an Azure Disk Encryption Prerequisite Setup script on GitHub. The script will create the Azure Active Directory Application for you.

	  Azure Disk Encryption generates and writes the encryption keys to your key vault. The Azure Active Directory Application helps you manage encryption keys in your key vault. 

	  You will run this script first to prepare to encrypt VMs.

1. In the blue PowerShell pane, type the following command, and press **Enter**

    ```powershell
   Login-AzureRMAccount
    ```

    >**NOTE:** You will be prompted to log in to your Azure account.  At this point, you are connecting **PowerShell** to Azure.

1. In the **Email or phone** field, type **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail" />**

1. Click **Next**

1. In the **Password** field, type **<inject key="azureaduserpassword" />**

1. Click **Sign in**

    >**NOTE:** Your PowerShell session is now connected to your Azure lab environment, which has multiple subscriptions.  We need to ensure the subsequent PowerShell commands target a specific Azure subscription.

1. In the blue PowerShell ISE pane, type the following command

    ```powershell
   Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "[SubscriptionName]"
    ``` 
  
1. Replace [SubscriptionName] with **<inject story-id="story://content-private/content/iai/sec/securityshared" key="subscriptionname"/>** and press **Enter**

1. In the blue PowerShell ISE pane, type the following command, and press **Enter**

    ```powershell
    Set-Location C:\Users\LabUser\Documents\Encryption
    ```

    >**NOTE:** Running this command sets the correct local PowerShell context to be the correct location to run the Azure Disk Encryption Prerequisite Setup tool.

1. Click the **New** icon ![New Script](imgs/newscript.png) in the toolbar

1. In the white PowerShell window, type the following command:

    ```powershell
    .\AzureDiskEncryptionPrerequisiteSetup.ps1 -subscriptionid **INSERT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID** -keyEncryptionKeyName ContosoBitLockerKey
    ```
1. In the blue PowerShell ISE pane, copy the **SubscriptionId** under the **"Select-AzureRmSubscription"** output from step 7 to your clipboard

1. In the line of code, replace <b> ** INSERT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID ** </b> with the **SubscriptionID** that was copied in step 12

1. Click the **Run Script** button ![New Script](imgs/runscript.png) in the toolbar

1. When prompted for **resourceGroupName**, type **<inject story-id="story://content-private/content/iai/sec/securityshared" key="resourcegroupname" />**

1. Press **Enter**

1. When prompted for **keyVaultName**, type **<inject story-id="story://content-private/content/iai/sec/securityshared" key="keyvaultname" />**

1. Press **Enter**

1. When prompted for **location**, type **<inject story-id="story://content-private/content/iai/sec/securityshared" key="resourcegrouplocation" />**

1. Press **Enter**

1. When prompted for **aadAppName**, type **<inject story-id="story://content-private/content/iai/sec/securityshared" key="resourcegroupname" />**

    >**Note:** The AAD application might be overloaded in this lab environment, so we are using the resource group name to enable a successful lab experience. In your own environment, the AAD application name will likely be shared .

1. Press **Enter** 

    >**NOTE:** Although you are already connected to the Azure Portal via your web browser, PowerhShell is not connected - A prompt to **Please log into Azure now** will appear.

1. In the **Email or phone** field, type **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail" />**

1. Click **Next**

1. In the **Password** field, type **<inject key="AzureAdUserPassword" />**

1. Click **Sign in**

    >**NOTE:** Azure authenticates the credentials and then closes the window. After the script completes, it outputs the current values for objects that will be needed to enable encryption on the VMs.

1. Copy the following from the PowerShell window to the clipboard by selecting the output and pressing **CTRL+C**:

    **aadClientID**  
    **aadClientSecret**  
    **keyVaultResourceId**  
    **keyEncryptionKeyUrl**  

1. [Click here to open Notepad](launch://launch_notepad)

1. In Notepad, paste the list by pressing **CTRL+V**

    >**NOTE:** The PowerShell output window limits each line to 80 characters, and the last two lines often wrap a few characters.  You should correct the line-wrap issue now, in Notepad, so that you paste proper values later in this lab.

1. Switch back to the PowerShell window and press **Enter**

      >**NOTE:** For the purpose of this scenario, assume you have already created the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template required to deploy a new Azure Virtual Machine called Coffee-Pot01, with an encrypted OS disk. This template is named "EncryptVMTemplate.json," and has an associated parameters file called "EncryptVMParameters.json" which must be modified with unique values generated by the "AzureDiskEncryptionPrerequisiteScript.ps1" script executed previously.

1. [Click here to open Notepad](launch://launch_notepad)

1. In Notepad, click **File**

1. Click **Open...**

1. In the **Open** screen, click **Documents** under **Quick access** 

1. Double-click the **Encryption** folder

1. In the bottom right corner, select the dropdown menu currently displaying **Text Documents (\*.txt)**

1. In the dropdown menu, select **All Files**

1. Click the **EncryptVMParameters.json** file

1. Click **Open**

     >**NOTE:** The "EncryptVMParameters.json" file that is open contains the unique parameters which will be used by the ARM template-based deployment.

1. Locate and replace the following values in the **EncryptVMParameters.json** file:

      >Replace the **newStorageAccountName** value of **STORAGECHANGE** to **<inject story-id="story://content-private/content/iai/sec/securityshared" key="storagename" />**

      >Replace the **aadClientID** value of **AADCLIENTCHANGE** to the **aadClientID** output from the PowerShell script run earlier

      >Replace the **aadClientSecret** value of **AADSECRETCHANGE** to the **aadClientSecret** output from the PowerShell script run earlier

      >Replace the **keyVaultName** value of **VAULTNAMECHANGE** to **<inject story-id="story://content-private/content/iai/sec/securityshared" key="keyvaultname" />**

      >Replace the **keyVaultResourceGroup value** of **KEYVAULTRGCHANGE** to **<inject story-id="story://content-private/content/iai/sec/securityshared" key="resourcegroupname" />**

      >Replace the **keyEncryptionKeyURL** value of **KEYURLCHANGE** with the **keyEncryptionKeyURL** output from the PowerShell script run earlier
      
      >**Note:** Make sure that the **KeyEncryptionKeyURL** is pasted in a single line

1. On the **Resource** blade, click **Virtual machines**

1. Click the name of the new virtual machine that you just created named **Coffee-Pot01** 

1. Under the **SETTINGS** category, click **Disks**
 
      > On the **Disks** blade, note that encryption has been enabled on the OS disk.

1. Leave PowerShell ISE and Notepad open for the next scenario

You have successfully built a new Azure virtual machine with encrypted virtual disks and stored the keys securely in the Azure Key Vault. You will now conduct further testing of Azure Disk Encryption, including applying encryption to virtual disks attached to pre-existing virtual machines.
