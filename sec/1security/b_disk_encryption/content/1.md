# Encrypting Existing VM Disks

Following a successful proof-of-concept for encrypting disks on a newly built virtual machine, you have now been tasked with encrypting the virtual disks of a line-of-business application VM.

1. In PowerShell ISE, click the **New** icon ![New Script](imgs/newscript.png) in the toolbar

      >**NOTE:** The previous scenario has already connected this PowerShell ISE to the appropriate subscription for this scenario.

1. Copy and paste the following code into the white PowerShell ISE pane:

      ```powershell
      $aadClientID = "AADCLIENTCHANGE"
      $aadClientSecret = "AADSECRETCHANGE"
      $resourceGroupName = "RESOURCEGROUP"
      $diskEncryptionKeyVaultUrl = "KEYURLCHANGE"
      $keyVaultResourceId = "KEYVAULTRESOURCEID"
      ```

1. Locate and replace the following values using the information copied to Notepad in the previous scenario:

      >Replace **AADCLIENTCHANGE** with the **aadClientID** output

      >Replace **AADSECRETCHANGE** with the **aadClientSecret** output

      >Replace **RESOURCEGROUP** with **<inject story-id="story://content-private/content/iai/sec/securityshared" key="resourcegroupname" />**

      >Replace **KEYURLCHANGE** with the **keyEncryptionKeyURL** output

      >**Note:** Make sure that the **KeyEncryptionKeyURL** is pasted in a single line    

      >Replace **KEYVAULTRESOURCEID** with the **KeyVaultResourceID** output 

      >**Note:** Make sure that the **KeyVaultResourceID** is pasted in a single line

1. In the toolbar, click the **Run Script** button ![New Script](imgs/runscript.png)

      >**NOTE:** The variables **$aadClientID**, **$aadClientSecret**, **$resourceGroupName**, **$diskEncryptionKeyVaultUrl**, and **$keyVaultResourceId** have been defined in PowerShell and can now be called by other commandlets.

1. Copy the following code and paste it into the blue PowerShell pane:

      ```powershell
      Set-AzureRmVMDiskEncryptionExtension -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -VMName "DC01" -AadClientID $aadClientID -AadClientSecret $aadClientSecret -DiskEncryptionKeyVaultUrl $diskEncryptionKeyVaultUrl -DiskEncryptionKeyVaultId $keyVaultResourceId -Verbose
      ```

1. Press **Enter**

1. On the **Enable AzureDiskEncryption on the VM** message, click **Yes**

     >**NOTE:** Encrypting the virtual machine will take approximately 5 minutes for the operation to complete.

1. Return to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)

1. On the **Resource** blade, click **Virtual machines**

1.  Click the name of the virtual machine you encrypted named **DC01**

1.  In the **SETTINGS** category, click **Disks** 
 
      >**NOTE:** On the **Disks** blade, note that encryption has been enabled on the OS Disk. 

1. Close all open windows without saving any changes
