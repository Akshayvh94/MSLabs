#### Experience E - Azure Traffic Manager

Now that you have created web server farms and deployed web sites running across the world, you will create a public-facing service so the public can access the websites without having to know the specific URL for a specific web app instance. You will deploy an Azure Traffic Manager resource which will help direct a customer to the endpoint that will provide the best possible experience. Azure Traffic Manager can also be used for failover protection, redundancy, round robbin, and load distribution.

1. Return to the **ContosoPaaS.json** file in **Visual Studio** 

1. In the **resources** section, paste the following lines in between the **}** and closing **],** bracket of the resources section to begin a new code block for the traffic manager

    ```
	,
	{
      "name": "[concat(parameters('webAppNamePrefix'),'-tm-',uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]",
      "type": "Microsoft.Network/trafficManagerProfiles",
      "apiVersion": "2015-11-01",
      "location": "global",
	}
    ```
    > **Note:** The traffic manager will use the same function for naming as the other resources you have added. The location is set to global because the traffic manager is a resource that doesn't require a specific geographical location. 

1. Insert a new blank line under **"location": "global",**

1. On the new blank line, under the **"location":** property, paste the following 

    ```
	      "dependsOn": [
        "siteCopy"
      ],
    ```
	
    > **Note:** This creates a dependency in the template requiring the siteCopy function to be completed before the traffic manager resource can be deployed. 	  

1. Under the **"dependsOn":** property, paste the following 

    ```
      "properties": {
        "profileStatus": "Enabled",
        "trafficRoutingMethod": "Performance",
        "dnsConfig": {
          "relativeName": "[concat(parameters('webAppNamePrefix'),'-tm-',uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]",
          "ttl": 30
        }
      },
    ```
	
    > **Note:** This will automatically enable the traffic manager, establish the routing method, and configure the DNS for the traffic manager

1. Under the **"properties":** property, before the closing **}** paste the following

    ```
	   "monitorConfig": {
          "protocol": "HTTP",
          "port": 80,
          "path": "/"
        },
    ```
	
    > **Note:** This establishes the monitoring configuration the Traffic Manager will apply to each endpoint using the HTTP protocol on port 80 with a flat relative path.

1. Under the **"monitorConfig":** property, paste the following to open a code block for the endpoints

    ```
        "endpoints": [

        ],
    ```

1. In the **blank line** in between the [ ] brackets, paste the following endpoint code block **FOUR** times - one for each endpoint that needs to be configured

    ```
          {
            "name": "[concat(parameters('webAppNamePrefix'),'-endpoint-','0')]",
            "type": "Microsoft.Network/trafficManagerProfiles/azureEndpoints",
            "properties": {
              "targetResourceId": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Web/sites/',concat(parameters('webAppNamePrefix'),'-site-','0','-',uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)))]",
              "endpointStatus": "Enabled"
            }
          },
    ```
    > **Note:** The name of the endpoint will be **webAppNamePrefix-endpoint-** followed by a resource number.

1. In the **"name":** property of the second endpoint code block, change the **-0-** to **-1-** 

1. In the **"targetResourceId":** property of the second endpoint code block, change the **-0-** to **-1-** 

1. In the **"name":** property of the third endpoint code block, change the **-0-** to **-2-**

1. In the **"targetResourceId":** property of the second endpoint code block, change the **-0-** to **-2-** 

1. In the **"name":** property of the last endpoint code block, change the **-0-** to **-3-**

1. In the **"targetResourceId":** property of the second endpoint code block, change the **-0-** to **-3-** 

1. After the **closing ] bracket** of the endpoints code block, verify the end of the file has the following bracket structure

	> **Note:** The end of the file should now look like this:

    ```
                    "endpointStatus": "Enabled"
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
    ],
    "outputs": {

    }
    }
    ```

1. **Save** the **ContosoPaaS.json** file

1. Return to **PowerShell ISE**

1. Highlight the **New-AzureRMResourceGroupDeployment** commandlet and click **Run selection** ![image](imgs/runselection.png)

1. Return to the **Azure portal**

1. **Close** the **contoso-site-0** blade

1. **Refresh** the **Resource group** blade

1. In the **resource** list, click on the **Traffic Manager profile** resource to open it

1. From the **Overview** blade, review the four deployed endpoints and the regions in which the endpoints were deployed 

1. Click on the **DNS Name URL** to open the **App Service** via the newly deployed **Traffic Manager** based **URL**

    > **Note:** Leave this tab open so you can easily return to it to view the new content you are now going to deploy to the sites.

Now that we've deployed a fully functional web platform, it's time to take the last step, which is to populate our websites with a specific web application.
