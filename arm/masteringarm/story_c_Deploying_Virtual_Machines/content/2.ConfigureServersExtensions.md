#### Experience C - Configure Windows Servers with PowerShell DSC VM Extensions

Now you will configure the basic VM servers that were just deployed into your remote Azure network. ARM can be used to configure them as applicationan web server. You will do this through adding a Virtual Machine Extension using PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC)

1. Return to the **Azure portal** and navigate to the  **<inject story-id="story://content-private/content/iai/arm/masteringarmshared" key="resourceGroupName"/>** resource group blade 

1. Click on **vmPrivate** to open the **Overview** blade for the private VM

1. Click on **Extensions** in the **SETTINGS** menu

1. The **MicrosoftMonitoringAgent** extension **may** show installed; however this should be the only extension that displays.

1. **Close** the Extensions blade

1. Return to **Visual Studio** and the **contosoIaaS_3.json** file 

1. In the **JSON Outline**, click on **resources**

1. In the **resources** section, right-click on the **[concat('vmweb','-',copyIndex())]** virtual machine resource and choose **Add New Resource**

1. In the **Search** box, type **PowerShell**

1. In the **search results**, click on **PowerShell DSC Extension** 

1. In the **Name:** section, type **vmweb**

1. In the **Virtual machine:** drop-down menu, select **[concat('vmweb','-',copyIndex())]** from the list

1. Click **Add**

1. In the **JSON Outline**, you can see that there is now a child resource to the **[concat('vmweb','-',copyIndex())]** virtual machine resource

    > **Note:** This means, when the virtual machine is deployed, the extension will be deployed automatically. It is also possible to define a VM extension as a completely independent resource with a dependency for a parent virtual machine. Now you will adjust the resource settings for your ARM deployment and identify the specific extension needed on each VM.

1. In the **"name":** property of the **vmweb** child resource, change the name from **"microsoft.Powershell.DSC"** to **"IIS"** 

1. In the **"tags":** property of the **vmweb** child resource, change the **"displayName":** from **"vmweb"** to **"IIS"**

1. In **"properties":** replace the **"settings"**: code block on lines 413-422 with the following:  
    ```
              "settings": {
              "modulesUrl": "[parameters('vmwebIISDSCModule')]",
              "configurationFunction": "[parameters('vmwebIISDSCFunction')]",
              "Properties": {
                "MachineName": "[concat('vmweb','-',copyIndex())]"
              }
            },
    ```
1. Refer to the image below to verify the code block pasted correctly, as the image represents what the code should look like 

1. ![image](imgs/step17code.jpg)

1. In the **"protectedSettings":** property, **delete** the **"configurationUrlSasToken":** line

1. In the **JSON Outline**, click on **variables**

1. Right-click on the **vmwebArchiveFolder** variable and choose **Delete**

1. Right-click on the **vmwebArchiveFileName** variable and choose **Delete**

1. In the **JSON Outline**, click on **parameters**

1. Right-click on the **_artifactsLocation** parameter and choose **Delete**

1. Right-click on the **_artifactsLocationSasToken** parameter and choose **Delete**

1. At the end of the **parameters** section, but before the last **},** paste the following lines
    ```
    "vmwebIISDSCModule": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/raw/master/dsc-extension-iis-server-windows-vm/ContosoWebsite.ps1.zip"
    },
    ```
1. This tells ARM the location to install the IIS server extension on each virtual machine as they are deployed from the Azure Quickstart Template. For this lab, you will be using a zip file that is loaded on a GitHub repository.

1. Under the **vmwebIISDSCMOdule** parameter, paste the following lines

    ```
    "vmwebIISDSCFunction": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "ContosoWebsite.ps1\\ContosoWebsite"
    }
    ```

    > **Note:** This will tell ARM which configuration function to run - this will apply the ContosoWebsite configuration.

1. Click **File > Save** to save the **ContosoIaaS_3.json** file in Visual Studio

1. Return to **PowerShell ISE** 

1. Highlight the **New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment** command and click **Run selection** ![image](imgs/runselection.png)

    > **Note:** The deployment and installation will take approximately five minutes. As the script runs, you can see that the resources look pretty much the same, except for right at the end where the Microsoft.compute/virtualmachine/extension resource type is provisioned. You can see that each of them are a child resource of the parent virtual machine.  

1. After the deployment is done, return to the **Azure portal** and refresh the **<inject story-id="story://content-private/content/iai/arm/masteringarmshared" key="resourceGroupName"/>** resource group 

1. In the **Resources** list, click on the **as-vmweb** Availability set

1. Now, click on either one of the Virtual Machines listed, **vmweb-0** or **vmweb-1**

1. In the **SETTINGS** menu, click on **Extensions**

1. Verify that the **IIS** extension is listed and the **STATUS** is **Provisioning succeeded**

1. If you wish, you can return to the **as-vmweb** Availability set blade, and click on the other Virtual Machine to verify that the **IIS** extension shows the same status if you wish.

So, we have now configured our remote servers to be application web servers, using ARM and PowerShell desired state configuration.
