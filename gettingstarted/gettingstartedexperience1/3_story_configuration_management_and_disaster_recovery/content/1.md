After the vault is deployed, refresh the **Recovery Services vaults** screen and click the **DemoLabRSV** to review the settings and available options on the **Overview** blade, including the **Backup** and **Replicate** action buttons and the tiles that appear for **Backup Alerts**, **Site Recovery Health**, **Backup Items**, **Backup Usage**, and **Backup Jobs**

    >**Note:** In the **Getting Started** settings, there is a **Site Recovery** option that will allow you to set up a hot standby or disaster recovery site in three steps. It is a detailed process to setup, but the **Wizard** walks users through the process to create the site recovery options.

1. In the **GETTING STARTED** section, click **Backup**
