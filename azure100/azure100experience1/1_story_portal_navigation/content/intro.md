**Azure Foundations &amp; Management**

_Getting started with the Azure portal_

## **Overview**

Microsoft Azure is a multi-tenant, public cloud computing platform. It is designed for building, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters. It provides SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and supports many different programming languages, tools, and frameworks, including both Microsoft and third-party software and systems.

In this lab, we will be focusing on the Azure foundation. The following topics/objectives will be covered:

- Portals and Navigation
- Accounts, Subscriptions, and Usage
- Classic vs. Resource Manager

## **Portals and Navigation**

- The portal is a central place to deploy and manage Azure resources. It is a comprehensive marketplace that allows the user to browse through thousands of items from Microsoft (and others) that can be purchased and/or provisioned on the Azure cloud platform.

- The portal provides a unified and scalable browser experience that makes it easy to find resources that can be used to perform various management operations.

- The portal contains management web pages (referred to as **blades**) including settings, actions, billing information, health monitoring, usage data, and other configuration options that the user can manage.

- The portal provides a customizable experience that allows the user to create a dashboard that will display information that is important to the individual user. Some settings and options (which are displayed as **tiles** ) that can be displayed on the dashboard can include:
  - **All resources** (displays deployed resources in all subscriptions by default)
  - **Service health** (displays the availability status of the Azure datacenters)
  - **Help + support** (Log support tickets and connect to the support community)
  - **Marketplace** (browse Microsoft and third-party offerings to purchase and/or provision in Azure)
  - **Settings** (set default preferences for dashboard color, subscription filter, language settings, and more)

**Capabilities or components used in this scenario:** 

- **Azure:** Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
