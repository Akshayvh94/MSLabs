# **Advanced Virtual Machines &amp; Compute Conclusion:**

The Advanced Virtual Machines &amp; Compute lab has now been completed. Through the completion of this lab, the following elements have been reviewed:

- Creating Scale Sets
- Linux VM Management with PowerShell
- ARM Templates

With the completion of this lab, an IT professional should be able to deploy advanced features of a virtual machine. Virtual Machine Scale Sets are a way to deploy and manage a set of identical VMs to dynamically provide more resources to be used by a pool of virtual machines. ARM templates were also reviewed as part of this lab. ARM Templates are a key feature of the Azure platform because they enable rapid &quot;rinse-and-repeat&quot; VM deployments in Azure. The last area of focus in this lab was managing a Linux server using PowerShell. PowerShell is a critical tool for managing resources in Azure. Microsoft has embraced third-party operating systems by adding PowerShell functionality for Linux VMs in Azure.
