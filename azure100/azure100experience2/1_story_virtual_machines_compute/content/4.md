## **Scenario 5 - Backup and Recovery**

A virtual machine is protected by a locally redundant storage account, which means that it is replicated and only accessible to Microsoft in the event of a datacenter outage. In this lab, we will configure a separate backup of the VM that will be user-accessible for recovery.
 
1. From the **Dashboard** screen, click the expand menu icon ![Expand icon image](imgs/expand.png) from the top left to expand the **Favorites** menu if it is collapsed
