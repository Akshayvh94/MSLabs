_Deploy a Windows Server 2016 Datacenter Virtual Machine in Azure_

### **Overview**

Microsoft Azure is one of the key cloud platforms currently providing cloud computing to the enterprise market. Azure launched in 2010 and has quickly matured as many new services are continually being added. One of the first and most popular services offered in Azure is **Virtual Machines** , an IaaS solution.

This lab will create and deploy a Windows Server 2016 Datacenter  virtual machine.

In this lab, the essential concepts for deploying a virtual machine will be explored by creating the following components:

- Resource Group
- Virtual Network
- Storage Account

During the creation of the virtual machine, additional properties will be reviewed, including the following:

- Availability Sets
- Dynamic vs Static IP Address
- Network Security Groups

**Capabilities or Components Used in this Story:**
